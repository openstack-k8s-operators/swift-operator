# swift-operator
The swift-operator is an OpenShift Operator built using the
[Operator Framework for Go](https://github.com/operator-framework) and provides
an easy way to install and manage an OpenStack Swift installation on OpenShift.

Some useful information about the implementation might be found in the [Design
Decisisons](docs/design-decisions.md).

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need an OpenShift cluster to run against, for example [Red Hat CodeReady Containers](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/2.0/html/getting_started_guide/index).

You also need a running Keystone instance and a few PersistentVolumes. There
are two simple ways to test this, both are using [install_yamls](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls).


### Setup CRC
```sh
git clone https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls
pushd install_yaml/devsetup
CPUS=12 MEMORY=25600 DISK=100 make crc
eval $(crc oc-env)
make crc_attach_default_interface
popd
```

### Deploy Swift
There are multiple ways to deploy Swift, one running only Keystone, MariaDB and
Swift and another one running a full OpenStack deployment using the
openstack-operator.

#### Deploy without using the openstack-operator
```sh
pushd install_yaml
# Setup PVs and deploy the operators
make crc_storage mariadb keystone swift
# Once operators are ready, deploy services
make mariadb_deploy keystone_deploy swift_deploy
popd
```

Once everything is ready a couple of pods should run including Swift:
```sh
$ oc get pods
NAME                           READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
keystone-6c76bbbd67-ctk6p      1/1     Running     0          69s
keystone-bootstrap-5x7r2       0/1     Completed   0          78s
keystone-db-create-lk5zv       0/1     Completed   0          99s
keystone-db-sync-ncntj         0/1     Completed   0          89s
mariadb-openstack              1/1     Running     0          100s
openstack-db-init-z8vgs        0/1     Completed   0          2m
swift-proxy-749fffd9f9-zjf57   3/3     Running     0          77s
swift-ring-rebalance-46vnr     0/1     Completed   0          93s
swift-storage-0                16/16   Running     0          2m2s
```

#### Deploy using the openstack-operator
```sh
pushd install_yaml
# Setup PVs and deploy the operators
make crc_storage input openstack
# Once operators are ready, deploy services
make openstack_deploy
popd
```

### Accessing Swift using the CLI

You can use the `openstackclient` CLI to access the Swift deployment directly,
for example:

```sh
$ oc rsh openstackclient
$ openstack container create test
$ openstack object save test obj
```

If you want to use the `swift` CLI instead, use the openstackclient pod and set the required OS_ env variables:

```sh
$ oc rsh openstackclient

$ export OS_AUTH_URL=$(grep -o 'https.*' ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml)
$ export OS_USERNAME=$(grep -Po '(?<=username: ).*' ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml)
$ export OS_PROJECT_NAME=$(grep -Po '(?<=project_name: ).*' ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml)
$ export OS_PASSWORD=$(grep -Po '(?<=password: ").*(?=")' ~/.config/openstack/secure.yaml)
$ export OS_AUTH_VERSION=3
```

You can now use the `swift` command directly, for example:

```sh
$ swift stat -v
            StorageURL: http://swift-public-openstack.apps-crc.testing/v1/AUTH_ebc5...
